### Get Started

The concept behind the Mac Hacks project is to document the best ways to automate the installation of software that I use. Feel free to use anything on this site as your own.

I wipe my Mac twice a year, January 1st and June 1st. This keeps stuff fresh on my Mac, because I often mess things up. The problem is, it's very time consuming to get all of my applications set up manually. I am going to document everything here.

It's relatively simple to take everything I've posted here and throw it in a shell script to use to bootstrap your Mac. I keep a private repo with all of my required pieces for my bootstrap script. It will be made in a sanitized format soon.

#### Don't Be Stupid.

I'm not responsible for you doing irreversible damage to your Mac. Seriously, don't be stupid.
