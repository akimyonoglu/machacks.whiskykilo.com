#### Stop the Hostname Changes

OS X renames itself a lot. It drives me nuts, so here's how to stop that behavior.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo scutil --set HostName bobjonescomputer
sudo echo "HOSTNAME=bobjonescomputer">>/etc/hostconfig
sudo reboot
{% endhighlight %}

#### Time Machine Backup Interval

The default Time Machine backup interval is 60 minutes, but you can change it using the following command, where `1800` can be replaced in the value you want in seconds. (The below command will tell Time Machine to backup every 30 minutes)

{% highlight bash %}
sudo defaults write/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 1800
{% endhighlight %}
