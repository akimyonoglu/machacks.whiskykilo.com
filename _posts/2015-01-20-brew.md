### HomeBrew
* * *

This is a quick description of one of the most important apps that I use, [Brew](http://brew.sh). Since OS X does not have a native package manager that you can use from the command line, Brew (also known as HomeBrew), has filled in. A number of the applications that I use, from day to day, use Brew for installation.

A simple `brew install coreutils` will install a [whole bunch of stuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities), which is essential if you're used to working on Linux.

Brew is simple to install, and only has one requirement, Xcode Command Line tools:

{% highlight bash %}
xcode-select --install
{% endhighlight %}

Now that you have the command line tools installed, you can run a single command to install Brew:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

After Brew is installed, it's considered best practice to run the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
brew doctor
brew update
brew upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

### Brew Cask
* * *

Even more handy than Brew, is Brew Cask. It enables you to install all sorts of applications, including `VMware Fusion`, `Vagrant`, `1Password`, etc.

{% highlight bash %}
brew tap phinze/cask
brew install brew-cask
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can do cool things, like prepare an array of applications to iterate through and install:

{% highlight bash %}
brewCaskApps=(atom bartender caffeine crashplan dropbox flux github google-chrome istat-menus iterm2 little-snitch macvim 1password spotify vagrant vagrant-manager vmware-fusion)

brew cask install ${brewCaskApps[@]}
{% endhighlight %}
