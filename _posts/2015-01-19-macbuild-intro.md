### The Concept

The concept behind the MacBuild project is to document the best ways to automate the installation of software that I use. Feel free to use anything on this site as your own.

I wipe my Mac twice a year, January 1st and June 1st. This keeps stuff fresh on my Mac, because I often mess things up. The problem is, it's very time consuming to get all of my applications set up manually. I am going to document everything here.
